The Data: 
The example data used to model the app, is a dataset from kaggle: Germany City Rainfall Data. This dataset specifically contains 10 variables and 1080 observations based on weather and climate statistics from major cities in Germany. There are also 10 cities included with dates ranging from 2015-2023. Factors studied in this set include various quantitative variables, and categorical variables that were later encoded as factors. Such variables are listed below along with the dataset website. 

    City: Name of the city.
    Latitude: City's latitude in degrees.
    Longitude: City's longitude in degrees.
    Month: The month number (1-12).
    Year: The year of the data.
    Rainfall (mm): Rainfall amount in millimeters.
    Elevation (m): City’s elevation above sea level in meters.
    Climate_Type: The climate classification of the city.
    Temperature (°C): Average temperature for the month in Celsius.
    Humidity (%): Average humidity level for the month in percentage.

The data will be used to explore the relationships between variables in order to determine which factors affect rainfall. We are also able to analyze how the rainfall and other factors change over time.
