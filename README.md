* Project App



**The Data**: 
The example data used to model the app, is a dataset from kaggle: Germany City Rainfall Data. This dataset specifically contains 10 variables and 1080 observations based on weather and climate statistics from major cities in Germany. There are also 10 cities included with dates ranging from 2015-2023. Factors studied in this set include various quantitative variables, and categorical variables that were later encoded as factors. Such variables are listed below along with the dataset website. 

    City: Name of the city.
    Latitude: City's latitude in degrees.
    Longitude: City's longitude in degrees.
    Month: The month number (1-12).
    Year: The year of the data.
    Rainfall (mm): Rainfall amount in millimeters.
    Elevation (m): City’s elevation above sea level in meters.
    Climate_Type: The climate classification of the city.
    Temperature (°C): Average temperature for the month in Celsius.
    Humidity (%): Average humidity level for the month in percentage.

The data will be used to explore the relationships between variables in order to determine which factors affect rainfall. We are also able to analyze how the rainfall and other factors change over time. 

**The APP**:
This app is a R shiny dashboard created for the purpose of conducting a simple statistical exploration on data. This dashboard specifically explored the data as shown above and allows the users full control of adjusting the inputs. This app has 3 main tabs on exploring rainfall insights of German cities or perhaps other response variables selected. You can explore the total average rainfall, Temperature, Humidity of cities using the plot allocated to elevation, or maybe explore rainfall, Temperature or Humidity throughout 2015-2023 or more particularly between months. Anyways explore the app to know more.
